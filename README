Advent of Code 2024

- Attempting to do all problems with only modules included in the Python standard library or in my personal utility module.

- Assumes the existance of an `inputs/` and `outputs/` directory.

CAVEAT:

- The utils module requires `requests` to automatically retrieve inputs, and further requires storing the session cookie in a .mycookie file in the root directory. 

- Store your input file in `inputs/$day.in` before running the code as a workaround.
